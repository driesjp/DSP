# HaarWavelet.cpp

Specifies the path to an audio file.
Creates an instance of the Haar class for wavelet transformations.
Reads audio data from the specified file.
Applies the forward Haar wavelet transform to the audio data.
Plots a histogram of the wavelet coefficients to visualize their distribution.
Applies the inverse Haar wavelet transform to convert the data back to its original form.

It does not automatically compensate for the sample rate yet, it assumes 16-bit
